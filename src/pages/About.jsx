                <p>
                Hi, You can call me Adi (my nickname since birth).
                My legal name is quite long, actually. It's Muhammad Aziz Abdillah. 
                I am a coder who likes design. And I understand basic design theory too, especially usability design. 
                Weird, right? because both are quite the opposite. But for me, my main field is coding. 
                For design, I was just interested in this field before. And I respect the designer too. 
                because both fields are critical to the product line.
                And I like coding, even though I was traumatized by Java, and I was considering transitioning entirely from developer to designer. 
                But I prefer to build websites and systems rather than just imagine them. 
                I now have the confidence to pursue developer careers as a result of my experience teaching coding. 
                Okay, I believe that concludes my introduction. 
                My skills, educational background, and experience are listed below.Â
